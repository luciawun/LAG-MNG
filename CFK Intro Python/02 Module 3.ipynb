Once we've determined that one routine is a bottleneck for the performance of a program, we can replace it with a faster version by writing it in C. This is called *extending* Python, and there's a [good section in the standard documents](http://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html). This can be a tedious process if you have many different routines to convert. Fortunately, there are several other options.\n",

    "[Cython](http://www.cython.org/) is a C-extension language. You can start by compiling a Python routine into a shared object libraries that can be imported into faster versions of the routines. You can then add additional static typing and make other restrictions to further speed the code. Cython is generally easier than using Swig.\n",
